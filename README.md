## LaTeX template & package for a complete EB-1A I-140 petition

This is the LaTeX template for my EB-1A I-140 petition. See my blog-post for the timeline and on how to apply.

You are welcome to use this package to prepare your application. Also note that I anonymized certain parts of the application.

1. From the command line, clone the repository on your machine: 

`git clone git@github.com:razvanmarinescu/EB1A.git`

2. Install a TeX distribution from https://www.latex-project.org/get/, & install a LaTeX compiler such as TexMaker. 

3. Open main.tex in the LaTeX editor, modify the template, and compile. 

### Materials

Self-petitioning for an EB1A visa involves similar materials to those mentioned earlier. Here's a more detailed list:


Form I-140: This is the Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers form. You fill this out to demonstrate your eligibility.

Evidence of Extraordinary Ability: You must provide substantial evidence that you have sustained national or international acclaim in your field. This can be in the form of awards, media coverage, letters of recommendation, and other proof of your achievements.

Personal Statement: A detailed personal statement outlining your qualifications, accomplishments, and the significance of your work. This is an important part of the application where you can personally argue your case.

Letters of Recommendation: Letters from peers or experts in your field who can attest to your extraordinary ability. These letters should be detailed and speak to your specific achievements.

Filing Fee: The fee for filing Form I-140. The amount can vary, so check the USCIS website for the most current information.

Form G-1145 (optional): This form allows you to request e-notification when your application has been received.
